-Top-paying data analyst roles strongly favor engineering-oriented skills, with tools like PySpark, Databricks, Airflow, and Kubernetes commanding the highest salaries.
-Big data and distributed computing skills are major salary drivers, indicating that handling large-scale datasets is highly valued.
-Cloud and DevOps exposure (GCP, GitLab, Jenkins, Linux) significantly increases pay, showing demand for analysts who work in production environments.
-The Python ecosystem dominates high-paying roles, with Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter, and Scikit-learn appearing consistently.
-ML-adjacent tools (DataRobot, Watson, Scikit-learn) suggest analysts closer to machine learning workflows earn more.
-SQL remains essential but is no longer a top differentiator, as it is expected baseline knowledge rather than a premium skill
